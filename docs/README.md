## üéØ Learning Path

### Beginner (1-2 hours)
1. Read [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)
2. Try the LED circuit example
3. Browse [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md) for your use case
4. Experiment with `examples/basic_usage.py`

### Intermediate (Half day)
1. Read [WHY_USE_THIS_LIBRARY.md](WHY_USE_THIS_LIBRARY.md) for context
2. Study [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md) recipes for your domain
3. Reference [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md) as needed
4. Try `examples/advanced_usage.py`
5. Create your first automated circuit generator

### Advanced (1-2 days)
1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand internals
2. Study all recipes in [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md)
3. Integrate with your workflow (CI/CD, testing, etc.)
4. Consider contributing new recipes or features

### Expert (Ongoing)
1. Contribute to the library
2. Build MCP servers or extensions
3. Create templates for your organization
4. Help others in GitHub issues

## üí° Tips for Success

### Do's
‚úÖ Start simple - try the LED example first
‚úÖ Use recipes as templates - copy and modify
‚úÖ Leverage collections for efficient operations
‚úÖ Use type hints - excellent IDE support
‚úÖ Validate your circuits - use built-in validation
‚úÖ Test in KiCAD - open generated files to verify

### Don'ts
‚ùå Don't guess at API - check API_REFERENCE.md
‚ùå Don't manually calculate pins - use add_wire_between_pins()
‚ùå Don't write S-expressions - use high-level API
‚ùå Don't skip validation - catch errors early
‚ùå Don't ignore format preservation tests - they matter
