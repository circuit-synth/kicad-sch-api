# PRD: Professional Interactive Circuit Design Agent - FINAL

**Document Version:** FINAL  
**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Author:** Circuit-Synth Development Team  
**Status:** Approved for Implementation

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a professional interactive circuit design agent that serves as a **long-term engineering partner** throughout the entire design lifecycle. The agent works with users from initial concept through manufacturing and testing, maintaining comprehensive project memory and providing ongoing design guidance. Users interact with this agent as their **primary design interface**, whether creating new designs or analyzing existing ones.

## Revolutionary Design Partnership Model

### Long-Term Design Relationship
**Traditional**: Short interactions for specific tasks  
**New**: Ongoing partnership throughout design lifecycle

**Design Partnership Timeline:**
```
Initial Design â†’ Iterative Refinement â†’ Design Reviews â†’ Pre-Manufacturing â†’ 
Testing Support â†’ Manufacturing â†’ Post-Production Analysis â†’ Next Revision
                    â†‘
              Agent maintains context and provides
              guidance throughout entire lifecycle
```

### Primary Design Interface
This agent becomes the **default way users interact** with circuit designs:
- **New Designs**: "Let's design a sensor board for industrial monitoring"
- **Existing Analysis**: "Analyze this power supply design for efficiency improvements"  
- **Troubleshooting**: "Help me debug why this USB interface isn't enumerating"
- **Design Evolution**: "Upgrade this design for automotive temperature range"
