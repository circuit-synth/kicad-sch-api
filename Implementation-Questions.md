# kicad-sch-api Implementation Questions

Based on your PRD answers and additional requirements, I need to clarify some implementation details to ensure we build exactly what you need.

## Your Key New Requirements Summary

✅ **Understood Requirements**:
- Edit .kicad_pro files in addition to .kicad_sch files
- Allow users to add custom libraries of KiCAD symbols
- Support in-place file modification (not just creating new objects)
- Make it significantly different/better than kicad-skip
- Pull all relevant logic from circuit-synth
- Hierarchical schematic support (just placing hierarchical sheet components)
- KiCAD 9 only, fully open source, completely independent from circuit-synth
- Current dependencies: sexpdata (found in circuit-synth), continue with existing libraries

## Clarifying Questions

### **1. .kicad_pro File Manipulation**

**Question**: What specific .kicad_pro operations do you need?

**Context**: .kicad_pro files contain project settings, library paths, design rules, etc.

**Typical operations might include**:
- A) Add/remove library paths when users add custom symbol libraries
- B) Modify design rule settings 
- C) Update project metadata (version, description, etc.)
- D) Configure symbol library priority/search order
- E) All of the above + other project settings

**Which operations are priorities for v1.0?**
All of the above, but we'll start simple

### **2. Custom Symbol Library Integration**

**Question**: How should users specify and manage custom symbol libraries?

**Options**:
- A) **Library Registration API**: `api.add_library_path("/path/to/my_symbols.kicad_sym")`
- B) **Project-level Config**: Automatically detect from .kicad_pro library paths
- C) **Global Config**: System-wide library configuration
- D) **Runtime Discovery**: Scan directories for .kicad_sym files
- E) **Multiple approaches**: Combination of above

**Which approach fits your vision?**
Combination, keep it simple at first

**Follow-up**: Should the API:
- Auto-update .kicad_pro when libraries are added?
- Validate library files before adding them?
- Support library priority ordering?

LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT KICAD_PRO RIGHT NOW

### **3. In-Place File Modification Strategy**

**Question**: What's your preferred approach for in-place modification?

**Current kicad-skip approach**: Load entire file into memory, modify objects, save entire file

**Alternative approaches**:
- A) **Stream-based editing**: Modify specific sections without loading entire file
- B) **Delta-based updates**: Track changes and apply minimal edits
- C) **Atomic sections**: Load/modify/save only changed sections
- D) **Hybrid**: In-memory for small files, streaming for large files

Load entire file into memory.
**For performance with large schematics, which approach interests you?**

**Follow-up**: Should we support:
- Undo/redo for in-place modifications?
- Change tracking (what was modified when)?
- Concurrent modification protection (file locking)?

no, just a basic api that works robustly, then others can build logic on top of it

### **4. Differentiation from kicad-skip**

**Question**: What specific improvements should we prioritize over kicad-skip?

**Areas for improvement**:
- A) **Performance**: Faster loading, caching, optimized operations
- B) **API Design**: More intuitive, type-safe, validation-rich interface
- C) **File Format**: Better format preservation, exact output matching
- D) **Error Handling**: More detailed errors, graceful degradation, validation
- E) **Professional Features**: Backup/restore, atomic operations, transactions
- F) **Library Management**: Advanced sourcing, caching, validation
- G) **MCP Integration**: Native AI agent support

**Which of these are your top 3 priorities for differentiation?**
api design, file format & preserving previous schematic besides edits, professional features, MCP integration, all of the above
---

### **5. Circuit-Synth Component Integration**

**Question**: Which specific circuit-synth components should we prioritize for transfer?

**From your analysis of circuit-synth, key candidates**:

**Core Components**:
- `atomic_operations_exact.py` - Exact format preservation ✅ High Priority
- `sexpr_manipulator.py` - Advanced S-expression handling ✅ High Priority
- `core/s_expression.py` - Core parsing engine ✅ High Priority

**Library & Sourcing**:
- `library_sourcing/` - Multi-source component lookup
- `core/symbol_cache.py` - Intelligent symbol caching
- `kicad_symbol_parser.py` - Symbol library parsing

**Schematic Management**:
- `schematic/component_manager.py` - Component operations
- `schematic/wire_manager.py` - Wire/connection handling
- `schematic/placement.py` - Component placement algorithms

**Professional Features**:
- `atomic_integration.py` - Safe atomic operations
- Validation and error handling systems
- Performance monitoring and optimization

**Which components should we transfer first? Any we should skip or modify significantly?**
What use would we have for symbol cache?  would it really speed things up?

---

### **6. Architecture Differentiation Strategy**

**Question**: How should we structure the API to be meaningfully different from kicad-skip?

**kicad-skip's approach**:
```python
# kicad-skip style
sch = skip.Schematic('file.kicad_sch')
sch.symbol.R1.property.Value.value = "10k"
sch.save()
```

**Potential differentiated approaches**:

**Option A - Enhanced Object Model**:
```python
# More structured, type-safe
project = ksa.Project('project.kicad_pro')  # .kicad_pro support
sch = project.schematic('main.kicad_sch')
resistor = sch.components.get('R1')
resistor.value = "10k"  # Direct property access
resistor.footprint = "R_0603_1608Metric" 
project.save()  # Saves both .kicad_pro and .kicad_sch changes
```

**Option B - Transaction-Based**:
```python
# Atomic operations with rollback
with ksa.SchematicEditor('file.kicad_sch') as editor:
    editor.add_component('Device:R', ref='R1', value='10k', pos=(100, 100))
    editor.connect('R1.1', 'C1.2')
    # Auto-saves with exact format preservation on successful exit
```

**Option C - Fluent Interface**:
```python
# Method chaining for complex operations
result = (ksa.Schematic('file.kicad_sch')
    .add_component('Device:R', 'R1', '10k')
    .place_at(100, 100)
    .connect_to('C1', pin='2')
    .validate()
    .save_exact())
```

**Which style appeals to you for the primary API? Should we support multiple styles?**
What do modern api's do?  what are the benefits and drawbacks of each one? we will have hundreds of components and other parts in the files eventually

### **7. MCP Server Integration Details**

**Question**: How tightly should MCP tools integrate with the Python API?

**Options**:
- A) **Direct mapping**: Each MCP tool calls corresponding Python API method
- B) **High-level operations**: MCP tools perform complex multi-step operations
- C) **Agent-optimized**: MCP tools designed specifically for LLM understanding
- D) **Layered**: Support both direct mapping and high-level operations

**Example difference**:
```typescript
// Direct mapping approach
add_component(lib_id, reference, value, position)

// Agent-optimized approach  
create_resistor_divider(input_voltage, output_voltage, current_rating)
```

**Which approach better serves your intended use cases?**
let's keep it basic for now and try direct mapping

### **8. Performance and Scalability**

**Question**: What performance characteristics should we optimize for?

**Use case scenarios**:
- A) **Interactive editing**: Single operations on medium schematics (100-500 components)
- B) **Batch processing**: Many operations on large schematics (1000+ components) 
- C) **Agent workflows**: Sequential operations with validation between steps
- D) **Library operations**: Fast symbol lookup across many library files
- E) **In-place editing**: Minimal memory footprint for large file modifications

**Which scenarios are most important for your use cases?**
All of the above

**Follow-up**: Should we implement:
- Lazy loading of schematic sections?
- Component indexing for fast lookups?
- Operation caching and memoization?
- Parallel processing for batch operations?

Whatever we can do to speed up the workflow would be key.

### **9. Error Handling and Validation**

**Question**: What level of validation and error handling do you want?

**Validation levels**:
- A) **Syntax validation**: Ensure valid S-expression format
- B) **Semantic validation**: Check references, pin connections, etc.
- C) **Electrical validation**: Validate electrical rules (no floating pins, etc.)
- D) **Design validation**: Check against design rules, library constraints
- E) **Professional validation**: Manufacturing rules, component availability

**Which levels are important for v1.0?**
valid s-expr, design rule check is out of scope for this tool. we are just manipulating the kicad schematic

**Error handling approach**:
- A) **Fail fast**: Stop on first error with detailed message
- B) **Collect errors**: Gather all validation issues, report as list
- C) **Warning system**: Distinguish between errors and warnings
- D) **Auto-correction**: Attempt to fix common issues automatically

**Your preference?**
Collect errors

### **10. Testing and Quality Approach**

**Question**: How should we ensure quality given the "different from kicad-skip" requirement?

**Testing strategies**:
- A) **Reference implementation**: Test against known-good KiCAD files
- B) **Round-trip testing**: load → modify → save → load should preserve data
- C) **Format preservation**: Byte-level comparison with KiCAD's native output
- D) **Regression testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- E) **Integration testing**: Test MCP server with actual AI agents

**Which are most critical for ensuring professional quality?**
round trip testing, integration, reference implementation

## Next Steps

Once you answer these questions, I'll:

1. **Create detailed technical specification** based on your answers
2. **Design the differentiated architecture** that improves on kicad-skip
3. **Plan the component transfer strategy** from circuit-synth
4. **Begin implementation** with the core components

These answers will ensure we build exactly what you envision - a professional, differentiated alternative to kicad-skip with native AI agent support!
