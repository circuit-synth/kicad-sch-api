## Areas for Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Documentation (Priority: HIGH)
**Issues:**
- 5 broken documentation links in README.md
- Missing key documentation files:
  - `docs/api.md`
  - `docs/mcp.md`
  - `docs/development.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Impact:** Medium - affects developer onboarding and API understanding

**Recommendation:** Create missing documentation files and fix broken links

### 2. Test Coverage Gaps (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Untested Modules:**
- `discovery/search_index.py` - 0% coverage (192 lines)
- `core/pin_utils.py` - 0% coverage (66 lines)
- `core/simple_manhattan.py` - 14% coverage
- `core/wire_routing.py` - 14% coverage

**Impact:** Medium - these are utility modules, not core functionality

**Recommendation:** Add tests for search functionality and routing utilities

### 3. Component Rotation (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Issues:**
- 2 TODO comments about rotation not fully implemented
- `component_bounds.py:386` - "TODO: Handle component rotation in the future"
- `types.py:165` - "TODO: Apply rotation and symbol position transformation"

**Impact:** Low-Medium - rotation works for basic cases, edge cases may fail

**Recommendation:** Complete rotation implementation and add comprehensive rotation tests

### 4. Connectivity Analysis (Priority: LOW)
**Issue:**
- `wire.py:307` - "TODO: Implement more sophisticated connectivity analysis"

**Impact:** Low - basic connectivity works, advanced analysis missing

**Recommendation:** Enhance connectivity analysis for complex circuits
