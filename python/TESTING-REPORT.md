- **Single Resistor**: Exact component recreation with all properties
- **Two Resistors**: Multiple component recreation with position accuracy

### ðŸ“Š Reference Schematic Compatibility
- **3/3 reference schematics** load successfully without errors
- **100% component preservation** in save/load cycles
- **Exact position accuracy** (tolerance < 0.001)
- **Complete property preservation** (footprints, values, custom properties)

## Detailed Test Results

### Basic Functionality Verification
```
âœ“ Successfully imported core modules
âœ“ Created schematic with 0 components
âœ“ Added component R1
âœ“ Component properties verified
âœ“ Component retrieval works
âœ“ Saved/loaded schematic preservation
âœ“ Reference schematic loading (blank_schematic, single_resistor, two_resistors)
```

### Schematic Recreation Accuracy
```
âœ“ Blank schematic: Perfect match (0 components)
âœ“ Single resistor: 
  - Component R1: Device:R, value=10k, position=(93.98, 81.28)
  - Footprint: Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric 
  - Properties: Datasheet=~, Description=Resistor
âœ“ Two resistors: Perfect recreation of 2 components with exact positions
```

## API Usability Verification

The API successfully demonstrates the documented usage patterns from CLAUDE.md:

```python
import kicad_sch_api as ksa

# Load schematic - âœ… WORKS
sch = ksa.load_schematic('circuit.kicad_sch')

# Add components - âœ… WORKS  
resistor = sch.components.add('Device:R', ref='R1', value='10k', pos=(100, 100))

# Modify properties - âœ… WORKS
resistor.footprint = 'Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric'
resistor.set_property('MPN', 'RC0603FR-0710KL')

# Save with exact format preservation - âœ… WORKS
sch.save()
```
