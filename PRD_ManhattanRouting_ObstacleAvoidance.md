# Product Requirements Document: Manhattan Routing with Obstacle Avoidance

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing Manhattan-style wire routing with obstacle avoidance capabilities in the kicad-sch-api library. This builds upon the existing direct wire routing functionality to provide intelligent routing around component obstacles, filling a significant gap in the KiCAD schematic automation ecosystem.

## Market Research & Context

### Current State of Schematic Auto-Routing

**Research Summary:**
1. **PCB vs Schematic Routing**: Most EDA auto-routing research and tooling focuses on PCB layout, not schematic capture
2. **KiCAD Limitations**: KiCAD's Eeschema has no native automatic wire routing for schematics - only manual wire placement with grid snapping
3. **Industry Gap**: Major EDA tools (Altium, Eagle, KiCAD) lack sophisticated schematic auto-routing compared to their PCB routing capabilities
4. **Academic Foundation**: Manhattan routing is well-established in EDA research, constrained to horizontal/vertical paths for manufacturability

### Key Findings from Research

**Algorithmic Complexity:**
- Even simple routing problems (Steiner tree) are NP-complete
- Modern EDA tools rely on heuristics rather than optimal solutions
- Grid-based approaches are fundamental for constraint satisfaction

**Manhattan Grid Constraints:**
- Based on orthogonal routing (horizontal and vertical only)
- Standard KiCAD grid: 1.27mm (50 mil) for electrical connections
- Critical for maintaining design rule compliance and readability

**Auto-Routing Approaches:**
- **Global Routing**: Coarse-grain path planning around obstacles
- **Detailed Routing**: Fine-grain wire placement on grid
- **Interactive Routing**: Human-guided path with automated refinement
- **Rip-up and Reroute**: Iterative improvement through path modification

## Product Vision

**Enable intelligent schematic wire routing that matches the quality of manual engineering while dramatically reducing design time.**

Create a professional-grade Manhattan routing system that:
- Automatically routes around component obstacles
- Maintains perfect KiCAD grid alignment for electrical connectivity
- Provides multiple routing strategies (shortest path, clearance optimization, aesthetic quality)
- Integrates seamlessly with existing direct routing capabilities

## User Stories & Use Cases

### Primary User Persona: Circuit Design Engineers
Engineers using kicad-sch-api for automated schematic generation who need reliable wire routing in complex layouts.

**User Stories:**

1. **As a circuit designer**, I want to automatically route wires between distant components so that I don't have to manually calculate paths around obstacles.

2. **As an automation engineer**, I want the routing algorithm to respect component boundaries so that wires don't visually overlap with component symbols.

3. **As a schematic reviewer**, I want auto-routed wires to follow clean Manhattan paths so that the schematic remains readable and professional.

4. **As a KiCAD user**, I want routed wires to maintain perfect grid alignment so that electrical connectivity works correctly in KiCAD.

5. **As a design tool developer**, I want configurable routing strategies so that I can optimize for different scenarios (density vs aesthetics vs speed).

### Use Cases

**UC1: Dense Component Layout Routing**
- Context: Multiple components placed close together
- Goal: Route connections without wires passing through component bodies
- Success: Clean routing with appropriate clearance margins

**UC2: Long-Distance Connection Routing**

- Goal: Find efficient path with minimal wire length and turns
- Success: Reasonable path length with clean Manhattan geometry

**UC3: Multi-Net Routing**
- Context: Multiple wire networks need routing simultaneously  
- Goal: Route all connections without interference
- Success: All nets routed with no design rule violations

**UC4: Hierarchical Design Integration**

- Goal: Integrate with existing label-based connectivity
- Success: Proper routing to hierarchical labels and ports
